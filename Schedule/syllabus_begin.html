										<h1>Schedule</h1>
									</header>
									<p>
										Outlined below is the schedule for the course, including lecture topics and assignment due dates.  <b>All assignments are due at 11:59PM on the date specified</b>.  The specific dates of different topics are subject to change based on the pace at which we go through the course.
									</p>

									<p>
										Since Python is so popular, there has been a ton of community work across many projects.  Therefore, a big part of this course will be learning how to leverage work that others have already done, instead of re-inventing the wheel ourselves, by using ``software libraries'' for different tasks.  I have indicated the software libraries we will be using in the course at the beginning of each section.
