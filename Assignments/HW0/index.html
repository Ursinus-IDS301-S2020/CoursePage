                                            The purpose of this assignment is to get us setup for the course, both by getting to know each other better, and by setting up the software environment.

                                        <h3>Personal Survey (5 Pts)</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            I gave a couple of fun facts about myself in the class, but I want to get to know you all better.  So please submit answers to the following questions as a <u>private message</u> to me on Microsoft Teams
                                        </p>

                                            <li>What is your reason for taking the course? (Blunt honesty is perfectly fine here, if applicable)</li>

                                            <li>Have you had any experience with computer science / programming? (It's okay if you haven't!)</li>

                                            <li>Please attach <b>a headshot</b> to your message.  I will use this to help get to know your name, but we will also use this in class to arrange groups.</li>

                                        <h3>Doodle Poll for Office Hours</h3>

                                        <p>
                                            You will not be graded on this, but I want to setup my office hours so that everyone can make at least one of them.  Please <a href = "https://doodle.com/poll/9tvk8tzyx5kppdax">click here</a> and put a checkbox next to every hour block in which you can attend at least 30 minutes in your schedule.  You may use a pseudonym if you wish.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>Software Environment (5 pts)</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Please follow <a href = "../../Software">the directions on the software page</a> to install Anaconda Python on your computer.  Once you have Python installed, <a href = "test.py">click here</a> to download some code that we will use to test it, and place it in your <code>IDS301</code> folder (or wherever else you plan to store your class projects..but it is recommended that you keep them organized and back them up regularly).  Then, open Spyder, and go to <BR>
                                                <code>File->Open</code><BR>
                                            and open the <code>test.py</code> file that you just downloaded.  Finally, click the run button, which looks like this:<BR><BR>

                                                <img src = "Run.png">
                                            <BR><BR>
                                            Then, <b>send me a screenshot of the image that pops up in the console to the right of Spyder, using a private message on Microsoft Teams (5pts)</b>
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Please be sure also that you are able to launch Jupyter.  We will be using this in class for the first two weeks before we switch over to Spyder.
                                        </p>

                                        

                                        <h3>Syllabus (5 pts)</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with <a href = "../../">the course syllabus</a>.  Then, <b>please send me a third and final message on Microsoft Teams with the answers to the following questions</b>
                                            
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>True/False: If you choose to work with a buddy, you are allowed to look at your buddy's code and show them your code</li>

                                            </ol>
